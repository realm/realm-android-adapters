![Realm](logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.

This repository holds adapters for combining Realm Java with Android UI components and framework classes.

Currently supported UI components are:

 * [ListView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html)
 * [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html)

## Getting Started

This library only works together with Realm Java. Please see the [detailed instructions in our docs](https://realm.io/docs/java/#installation)
to add Realm to your project.

To add the adapters to your project, add the following to you app's dependencies:

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    api 'io.realm:android-adapters:2.1.1'
}
```

This library is only compatible with Realm Java 3.0.0 and above.

## Using Snapshots

If you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use a **-SNAPSHOT** release of the current development version of Realm via Gradle, available on [OJO](http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/io/realm/realm-android/)

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
    }
}

dependencies {
    api 'io.realm:android-adapters:<version>'
}
```

See [version.txt](version.txt) for the latest version number.

## Building Realm Android Adapters

In case you don't want to use the pre-compiled version, you can build the library from source.

Prerequisites:

 * Download/the [**JDK 7**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or [**JDK 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from Oracle and install it.
 * Download & install the Android SDK, **Android 7.1 (API 25)** (for example through Android Studio’s **Android SDK Manager**)

Once you have completed all the pre-requisites building Realm is done with a simple command

```
./gradlew assemble
```

That command will generate:

 * an aar file for the adapter library in `adapters/build/outputs/aar/android-adapters-release.aar`

### Other Commands

 * `./gradlew monkeyDebug` will run the monkey tests on the example project.
 * `./gradlew javadoc` will create the javadoc for the library.
 * `./gradlew artifactoryPublish` will upload a SNAPSHOT to OJO.
 * `./gradlew bintrayUpload` will upload a release to Bintray.
