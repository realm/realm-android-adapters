![Realm](logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.

This repository holds adapters for combining [realm-java](https://github.com/realm/realm-java) (the Realm Java SDK for Android) with Android UI components and framework classes.

Currently supported UI components are:

 * [ListView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html)
 * [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.html)

## Getting Started

This library only works together with the Realm Android SDK. Please see the
[detailed instructions in our docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/android/examples/adapters/)
for using this library.

To add the adapters to your project, add the following to you app's dependencies:

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'io.realm:android-adapters:4.1.0'
}
```

This library is only compatible with `realm-java` (the Realm Android SDK) 5.0.0 and above.

## Using Snapshots

If you want to test recent bugfixes or features that have not been packaged in an official release yet, you can use a **-SNAPSHOT** release of the current development version of Realm via Gradle, available on [OJO](http://oss.jfrog.org/oss-snapshot-local/io/realm/realm-android/)

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'http://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local'
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'io.realm:android-adapters:<version>'
}
```

See [version.txt](version.txt) for the latest version number.

## Building Realm Android Adapters

In case you don't want to use the pre-compiled version, you can build the library from source.

Prerequisites:

 * Download [**JDK 7**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) or [**JDK 8**](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and install it.
 * Download & install the Android SDK, **Android 7.1 (API 25)** (for example through Android Studio’s **Android SDK Manager**)

Once you have completed all the pre-requisites building the adapter library is done with a single command:

```
./gradlew assemble
```

That command will generate:

 * an `aar` file for the adapter library (`adapters/build/outputs/aar/android-adapters-release.aar`)

### Other Commands

 * `./gradlew monkeyDebug` will run the monkey tests on the example project.
 * `./gradlew javadoc` will create the javadoc for the library.
 * `./gradlew publishToSonatype` will upload artifacts to Maven Central.
 * `./gradlew bintrayUpload` will upload a release to Bintray.
